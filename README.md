Three-day group project developed during a weekend. The objective was to create a game/app that would run in terminal.

// The Idea

Our idea was to make a game in which two teams could have multiple people each and would compete against each other by solving various types of challenges, for example solving math problems. So we turned a well known physical game (Tug of war) into a computer mental game. Whoever solves equations && types faster, will win!

// The Development

With brainstorming, we decided what we were going to do and we set priorities.
Each one of us was responsible for different classes.
We used Prompt-view to work terminal.
This project was developed in Java 7.
